## The era of AMR

The AMR problem started as early as 1948, a year after the start of production of the first antibiotic called penicillin¹, and at the moment, infection is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Loss of effect in antibiotics due to AMR in bacteria is the impending threat against the continued success of cancer treatment. ² AMR has become almost present, not only in all known classes of antibiotics. ³. And some organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have considered antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as one of the major global threats ⁴.  
and  crucial global health concern, and it is the ability of pathogens to become resistant to antimicrobial drugs.

##    How pathogens acquired this trait

The capacity for coming out as antibiotic-resistant through some processes. First, genetic mutations in the pathogen’s DNA can alter the antibiotic’s target, thereby decreasing the drug’s affinity for its intended molecular target. ⁵. Second, resistance genes can be inherited by bacteria through the horizontal gene transfer mechanism like conjugation or transformation ⁶. Third, some pathogens secrete enzymes that can break down the antibiotic or chemically alter it to make it inactive ⁷.   
Fourth, pathogens can develop or up regulate efflux pumps that actively expel antibiotics from the cell, decreasing their intracellular concentration and effectiveness. ⁸. Fifth, changes in permeability of the pathogen’s cell membrane or wall can reduce the antibiotic’s entry, diminishing its ability to reach its target. ⁹. Finally, pathogens may modify the target site or bypass it entirely, making the antibiotic unable to bind effectively  ¹⁰.  
Cancer patients have a high risk of infections due to factors such as immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and the underlying malignancy itself. These treatments often lead to neutropenia and other immune deficiencies. ¹¹

## Global perspective case-study in AMR in cancer

. The causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in cancer epidemiology are multifaceted and are closely linked to the unique circumstances of cancer patients and their treatment. There is a real case study supporting this: 

Antimicrobial resistance or AMR is a major problem facing global cancer practice. An observational study of 500 leukemia patients upon samples taken from a network of international hospitals (January 2020- December 2021\) examined the pattern of AMR in bacterial infections. It was observed that, out of all the tested organisms, Escherichia coli had the highest level of resistance to ciprofloxacin 32% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin-tazobactam 28%. Methicillin resistance was also observed among the Staphylococcus isolates at a rate of 18% among which MRSA was present. Resistance was linked with longer duration of hospital stay and higher mortality. These findings underscore the imperative for widest adhesive for using antimicrobial stewardship and infection control interventions to combat AMR in cancer patients and complications.

## Conclusion

AMR in cancer epidemiology is a serious problem that we must solve quickly through steps that include expanding the production of new antibiotics that are not exposed to pathogens, increasing quality health care, and increasing health awareness in developing and poor areas that are highly crowded.
