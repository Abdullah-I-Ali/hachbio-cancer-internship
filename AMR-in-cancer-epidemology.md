Antimicrobial resistance(AMR) problem began in 1948, two years after penicillin production began ¹, and now \[Infection is the second leading cause of death in patients with cancer. Loss of efficacy in antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance(AMR) in bacteria is an urgent threat against the continuing success of cancer therapy\] ² and this phenomenon has become almost present in all known antibiotics    ³. and some organization such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recognized antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a global threat ⁴.

 

Antimicrobial resistance(AMR) is a critical world health issue which pathogens have

 

the ability to become resistant to antibiotics through some mechanisms. First, genetic mutations in the pathogen's DNA can alter the antibiotic’s target site, reducing the drug's ability to bind and inhibit its target ⁵. Second, pathogens can acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer via processes such as conjugation or transformation ⁶. Third, some pathogens produce enzymes that can inactivate or modify the antibiotic, rendering it ineffective ⁷. Fourth, pathogens can develop or upregulate efflux pumps that actively expel antibiotics from the cell, decreasing their intracellular concentration and effectiveness ⁸. Fifth, changes in permeability of the pathogen’s cell membrane or wall can reduce the antibiotic’s entry, diminishing its ability to reach its target ⁹. Finally, pathogens may modify the target site or bypass it entirely,

 

making the antibiotic unable to bind effectively ¹⁰.cancer patients have a high risk of infections due to factors as immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy ,radiation therapy and the underlying malignancy itself.these treatments often lead to neutropenia and other immune deficiencies ¹¹.

 

The causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in cancer epidemiology are multifaceted and are closely linked to the unique circumstances surrounding cancer patients and their treatment.There is a real case study support this:

 

Mr. Kumar, a 65-year-old Indian cancer patient:

 

faced significant challenges due to antibiotic resistance. Delayed diagnosis, limited access to healthcare, and the

 

emergence of a multi-drug resistant infection complicated his treatment. These factors led to treatment delays, increased morbidity, and heightened mortality risk.

 

To address such issues, India needs to improve healthcare access in rural areas, implement effective antibiotic stewardship programs, and invest in healthcare infrastructure. These measures can help prevent similar cases and ensure better outcomes for cancer patients.

 

in conclusion

 

AMR in cancer epidemology is a serious problem that we must solve quickly through steps that include expanding the production of new antibiotics that are not exposed to pathogens, increasing quality health care, and increasing health awareness in developing and poor areas

 

that are highly crowded.
