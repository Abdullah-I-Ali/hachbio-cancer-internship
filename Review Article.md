## **introduction**

Immunotherapy it's a treatment approach differs from chemotherapy and radiation which directly target cancer cell. Divided into types as : Checkpoint Inhibitors \- Car-T Therapy(the research point) \- Cancer Vaccines ...etc  
 This research entitled "Exploring the Impact of Gut Immune System on Immunotherapy for Non Cell Lung Cancer Patients" suppose that the presence of antibiotic resistance genes within the gut immune system can influence the success of immunotherapy in individuals diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L is an approach for NSCLC treatment its outcomes differ among patients and some may show resistance to the treatment, over time. The research is focused on finding markers, within the gut immune system that could hinders the outcomes of immunotherapy treatments.  
in this research they conduct research on 30 advanced NSCLC patients, 19 (57%) men and 11 (33%) women, treated with first- or second-line immunotherapy (nivolumab,pembrolizumab or atezolizumab).  
 

## **Methods**

 stool samples were taken from patients Patients who were treated with first- or second-line immunotherapy  
(nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab) from January 2019 to December 2020 before receiving immunotherapy and don't have same type of lunge cancer. on the clinical side, there are many factors to take into consideration, some of which include condition, smoking status,antibiotic use, and disease progression, etc..   
DNA Samples were counted and subjected to enrich antimicrobialgene(ARGs) to evaluation of resistance properties.  
They used advanced sequencing techniques. recording the use of antibiotics and dissecting them to monitor their effect.Intestinal resistance and its association with treatment results.

## **Results**

The researchers showed that gut resistance richness was positively associated  
How do patients respond to immunotherapy? Patients with progressive disease (PD/PC)  
It revealed a more significant level of representation of genes involved in resistance, especially to antibiotics. Such as: macrolides, lincosamides, and vancomycin. Some classes of resistance genes such as lnuC.  
These genes such as peptidase C (msrD) and erythromycin resistance gene (ermG) are associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.  
Unidentified macrolide- and vancomycin-resistant strains were more likely to be isolated in smokers, suggesting effects of smoking.  
Resistance genes, and patients who used antibiotics before immunotherapy are more likely to develop infections Greater levels of resistance signs.

## **Discussion**

Patients exhibiting PD-L1 expression were initially considered for immunotherapy; however,  
this does not apply to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition to PD-L1  
(Programmed Cell Death Ligand) markers, various genetic mutations play a significant role,  
including KRAS (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog), BRAF (B-Raf ProtoOncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase), STK11 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 11), and KEAP1 (Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1), without accounting for methylation levels or microRNA expression. Interestingly,  
individuals who had not been exposed to antibiotics in the four weeks preceding treatment with  
immune checkpoint inhibitors displayed some acquired resistant genes, potentially linked to prior antibiotic use, immunotherapy responses, or environmental influences such as smoking.  
Research indicates that smokers frequently require antibiotics due to heightened pulmonary  
infections, which can lead to the proliferation of multidrug resistance within the lungs and, to a  
broader extent, throughout the body. The study advocates for the administration of broadspectrum antibiotics, such as Fosfomycin and tetracyclines, which exhibit minimal resistance genes in microbiomes, to enhance treatment efficacy and prolong progression-free survival in NSCLC patients.

## **Conclusion**

The diverse population of patients with NSCLC may celebrate the most common treatment outcomes, with smoking affecting active participants varying in their numbers of resistance and therapeutic efficacy.
