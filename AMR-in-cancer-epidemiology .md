                                                   **AMR in cancer epidemiology**          
**The AMR problem started as early as 1948, a year after the start of production of the first antibiotic called penicillin¹, and at the moment, infection is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Loss of effect in antibiotics due to AMR in bacteria is the impending threat against the continued success of cancer treatment. ² AMR has become almost present, not only in all known classes of antibiotics. ³. And some organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have considered antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as one of the major global threats ⁴.**

**AMR is a crucial global health concern, and it is the ability of pathogens to become resistant to antimicrobial drugs.**

**The genetic mutations in the pathogen’s DNA can alter the antibiotic’s target, thereby decreasing the drug’s affinity for its intended molecular target. ⁵. Second, resistance genes can be inherited by bacteria through the horizontal gene transfer mechanism like conjugation or transformation ⁶. Third, some pathogens secrete enzymes that can break down the antibiotic or chemically alter it to make it inactive ⁷.**   
**Fourth, pathogens can develop or up regulate efflux pumps that actively expel antibiotics from the cell, decreasing their intracellular concentration and effectiveness. ⁸. Fifth, changes in permeability of the pathogen’s cell membrane or wall can reduce the antibiotic’s entry, diminishing its ability to reach its target. ⁹. Finally, pathogens may modify the target site or bypass it entirely, making the antibiotic unable to bind effectively  ¹⁰.**  
**Cancer patients have a high risk of infections due to factors such as immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and the underlying malignancy itself. These treatments often lead to neutropenia and other immune deficiencies. ¹¹. The causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in cancer epidemiology are multifaceted and are closely linked to the unique circumstances surrounding cancer patients and their treatment. There is a real case study supporting this:** 

**Mr. Kumar, a 65-year-old Indian cancer patient:**  
**Faced access to healthcare, and the emergence of a multi-drug-resistant infection, complicated his treatment. These factors led to treatment delays, increased morbidity, and heightened mortality risk.**  
**To address such issues, India needs to improve healthcare access in rural areas, implement effective antibiotic stewardship programs, and invest in healthcare infrastructure. These measures can help prevent similar cases and ensure better outcomes for cancer patients.**  
 **In conclusion**  
**AMR in cancer epidemiology is a serious problem that we must solve quickly through steps that include expanding the production of new antibiotics that are not exposed to pathogens, increasing quality health care, and increasing health awareness in developing and poor areas that are highly crowded.**
